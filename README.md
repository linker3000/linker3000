This is my repository for hobby projects and some reference material based on knowledge I have picked up over the years.

My hobby work extends from electronics to embedded devices, such as IoT sensors and other gadgets, like Z80 and 6502-based computers.

When time permits, I take a break from my hobbies and work in senior IT Service Management and technical IT roles. If you have a genuine interest in knowing more about my work skills, hop over to https://www.linker3000.com and get in touch.
